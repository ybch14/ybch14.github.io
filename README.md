# Hello

Welcome to Chen Yubo's blog. This blog contains some of the notes I've taken when reading papers, books or something else. Now the topics are updated to Computer Vision (temporarily including object detection, ImageNet evolution and semantic segmentation) and Natural Language Processing (temporarily including only some prior knowledge, deep learning methods are on the TODO list). The articles are all in Chinese since the papers are all in English. 

Hope this can push me learning all the time :-)

## About me

I'm a student at Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, and I'm going to graduate in 2018. After graduating, I'm becoming a PhD at THU-NGNLAB, and my research field is natural language processing and sentiment analysis. Also, I'm a research intern at Owlii Inc. in 2017 summer vacation, studying computer graphics and 3D deep learning.

## TODO

- DESIGN SIDE BAR NAV MENU
- Complete the above list
- read GoogLeNet, VGG, ResNet, ResNeXt and DenseNet
- read YOLO (Ross Girshirck new work)
- read DSOD (detection method without convolution network, based on densenet )
- read PSPNet (The highest accuracy of segmentation)

## Note

- This page originally come from jekyll Cayman theme. All the other parts and color adjustments are written by myself with CSS and JS. Writing a static web page is tried but interesting :-) The network architecture is supported by ```mermaid``` ([Github](https://github.com/knsv/mermaid)). Great thanks to the author!
- The side bar is under construction.
