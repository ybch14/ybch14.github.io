# Hello

Welcome to my blog. This blog contains some of the notes I've taken when reading papers, books or something else. Now the topics are updated to Computer Vision (temporarily including object detection, ImageNet evolution and semantic segmentation) and Natural Language Processing (temporarily including only some prior knowledge, deep learning methods are on the TODO list). The articles are all in Chinese since the papers are all in English. 

Hope this can push me learning all the time :-)

P.S.: Recently I'm reading *Introduction of Algorithm* and working on [this repo](https://github.com/ybch14/Intro-of-Algorithm-Implementation.git), this blog may be updating very slowly for a period of time.

## About me

I'm a starting Ph.D. student at THU-NGNLAB, Dept. of E.E., Tsinghua University, majoring NLP (more specifically, sentiment analysis and knowledge graph). In 2017 I was a research intern at Owlii Inc., studying computer graphics and 3D deep learning.

## TODO

- DESIGN SIDE BAR NAV MENU
- Complete the above list

## Note

- This page originally come from jekyll Cayman theme. All the other parts and color adjustments are written by myself with CSS and JS. Writing a static web page is tried but interesting :-) The network architecture is supported by ```mermaid``` ([Github](https://github.com/knsv/mermaid)). Great thanks to the author!
- The side bar is under construction.
