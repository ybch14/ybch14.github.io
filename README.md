# Hello

Welcome to Chen Yubo's blog. This blog contains some of the notes I've taken when reading papers, books or something else. Temporarily the notes only contains object detection and ImageNet Architecture evolution in Computer Vision topic. The articles will be gradually updated. 

Hope this can push me learning all the time :-)

## About me

I'm a student at Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, and I'm going to graduate in 2018. Also, I'm a research intern at Owlii Inc. in 2017 summer vacation. Currently I'm new at computer vision and deep learning, and I'm learning as much as I can.

- complete alexnet
- add 3D deep learing methods (pointnet etc.)
- read GoogLeNet, VGG, ResNet, ResNeXt and DenseNet
- read YOLO (Ross Girshirck new work)
- read DSOD (detection method without convolution network, based on densenet )
- read PSPNet (The highest accuracy of segmentation)

## Note

This page originally come from jekyll Cayman theme. All the other parts and color adjustments are written by myself with CSS and JS. Writing a static web page is tried but interesting :-) The network architecture is supported by ```mermaid``` ([Github](https://github.com/knsv/mermaid)). Great thanks to the author!
